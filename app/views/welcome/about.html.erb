				<h1 class="pg_title">About Me</h1>
				<p>My name is Geraldine Galue (pronounced 'Ga-loo-eh') and I was born and raised in Venezuela. I moved to Georgia in 2008 to attend Kennesaw State University. Although I majored in International Business and took courses in Industrial Engineering, I have always been very passionate about international affairs and Model United Nations.</p>
  			<p>The developing tech start-up scene in Atlanta has always intrigued me, which is why I am excited to be part of Tech Talent South's Fall-Winter 2015 Cohort. I come from a Marketing/Operations background, so I am excited to add 'coding' to my existing skill set.</p>
