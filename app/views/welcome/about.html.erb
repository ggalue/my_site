				<h1 class="pg_title">About Me</h1>
				<p>My name is Geraldine Galue (pronounced 'Ga-loo-eh') and I was born and raised in Venezuela. I moved to Georgia in 2008 for college. Although I majored in International Business and took courses in Industrial Engineering, the developing tech start-up scene in Atlanta had always caught my eye. In Fall 2015, I decided to take the plunge and joined Tech Talent South's full-time code immersion program and decided to learn how to code. Learning how to code in a short amount of time has certainly taught me a lot about myself and my capabilities. When I am not glued to my computer immersed in the wonderful world of coding, you can usually find me hanging out in tech meetups, restaurants in ATL, at the Beltline, or playing with my fur baby.</p>
